-- Prime Instinct Database Schema
-- This is a placeholder file.
-- You will need to export your actual database schema from your MySQL server
-- and replace the contents of this file with the SQL dump.

-- Example of how to export your database schema:
-- mysqldump -u root -p prime > schema.sql

-- The schema should include all tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, etc.
-- It should also include the default data like admin users.

-- WARNING: This file should be updated with your actual database schema
-- before deploying to Coolify.
